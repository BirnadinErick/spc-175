## FTP Credentials

If you are thinking about pushing to the upstream servers for either _beta_
or _production_, please ask me(Birnadin Erick) via any means for `upstream-config.xml`
file needed for both `push-upstream.sh` and `backup-upstream.sh`.

This file is unique for you and grants you read/write access via SFTP protocol.
You will be prompted for password, which is also unique to each file. **Make sure
you do not commit these files or their contents to the version control history**.

> By accepting a designated file, you take on responsibility for any actions
> executed via these credentials.
