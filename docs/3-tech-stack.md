## Tech Stack

> This website equips an experimental approach!

When we had the final direction of the website drawn, it was definite we need an amalgamation of website & webapp. Thus the full capable version of the website is to  be on v3.0.0 which will have the entire pre-determined requisites built.

The site is divided into 2 categories:
- website
	- houses the information for most of the people
	- news, academics, photos
- webapp
	- a portal for Alumni
	- user authentication for comments etc.

I initiated the project with a hope that any means will rise as the time passes by. So far I have decided to design the system for the website section( which is tracked as v1.0.0 milestone).

The Alumni team which sponsors the site has let us know that the site will initially on a shared hosting platform. So PHP it is. Frontend is to be chosen accordingly. At the time of writing -- HTMX is on fire, and I decided the Hypermedia-hype will be useful for this project as well.
