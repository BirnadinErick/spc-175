# ***Alma Mater! blest sanctum of learning, Where the mind is adorned with rich lore, And each tutored faculty’s yearning Is sated and taught to seek more.***

# 

# ***Alma Mater! Fond nurse of my childhood, So indulgent, yet prudently firm,Thy affection and smile cheer my boyhood, And foster each heavenly germ.***

# 

# ***Alma Mater! when launched on life’s ocean, Oft temptation must needs try thy child; Oh! where all tends to stifle devotion, Pray, Mother, lest I be defiled.***

# 

# ***Alma Mater! handmaid of Saint Patrick, May thy mission like his soon be crowned, And our Lanka, by Faith’s spark electric Chaste, learned like Erin be found.***
