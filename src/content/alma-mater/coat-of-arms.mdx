# The Coat of Arms of St. Patrick’s College, Jaffna.

###  ***The Coat of Arms is a design on a shield used by an institution as its own special symbol with special meaning. The Patrician Coat of Arms is enshrined with beautiful symbolism and noble ideals. Every Patrician should imbibe these ideals as his standard of perfection.***

### ***On the top of the crest, the College Motto is written in a scroll and the name of the College is displayed in the scroll at the bottom. The College Motto is “Fide et Labore” in Latin words which means “Faith and Work”. These words remind us that a Patrician’s life must be built on faith and hard work. The symbols depicted on the four quarters of the shield are: an open book, a lion, a lotus and three Bees.***

### ***The book is on the top quarter on the right on a field of gold. It has the Latin inscription “Its et Docete” which means “go and teach” It reminds us of Jesus, the supreme teacher, who sent his disciples to go and teach.***

### ***In the bottom quarter on the right, there are three golden bees on the field of crimson. The bees symbolize very hard work, which is the way to success. So a Patrician also should work hard and strive for excellence in studies and success in his career.***

### ***In the top quarter on the left, is a golden lion, on a field of crimson. It indicates courage, determination and leadership that are required of a Patrician who is a noble man.***

### ***In the centre of the shield we find the letters “OMI” meaning the Oblate Congregation. The Oblate missionaries were the pioneers in English education in the north of Sri Lanka. They managed the College for more than a century with missionaries of great calibre.***

### ***Below the shield, there is a wreath consisting laurels on the right, shamrocks on the left and a musical instrument more like a : “Jaffna Yarl” at its joint. The laurels symbolize the local wealth and resources. The shamrocks symbolize the Irish faith which is very strong and courageous. Both the Irish faith and the local resources blend together can bring out a good harmony - a perfect Melody***

### ***A Patrician is a noble man. His Coat of Arms also consists of noble ideals.***

### ***The Coat of Arms is the means of attaining perfection in life.***
